  1. Data Overview
     The Supermarket Sale dataset contains detailed transaction records from a retail supermarket chain operating across multiple branches and cities. Each entry represents an individual purchase and includes information such as the branch, city, customer type, product name, product category, quantity purchased, and total sales amount in USD.

The dataset comprises 253 rows and 8 columns, featuring both categorical variables (branch, city, customer_type, product_category) and numerical variables (quantity, total_price). This combination offers a clear and practical perspective on day-to-day retail operations and customer spending behaviors, making the dataset ideal for exploratory data analysis within a business analytics context.
